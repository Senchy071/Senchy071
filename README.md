Hi, I’m @Senchy071

I’m interested in web development. I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript by mixing The Odin Project and Free Code Camp (and everything else :) ).

Also, two excellent resources:    
	- [Kevin Powell's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob/about)    
	- [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/about)
